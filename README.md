An article that I find interesting is Eugen Kiss's *Lean Testing or Why Unit Tests are Worse than You Think*. Kiss examines unit testing from an economical perspective. He claims that end-to-end test are better than unit tests because they cover a larger portion of the codebase. This allows it to provide more confidence than unit tests. Unit tests may test edge cases that are not typically used, while end to end tests for critical paths. Unit tests are an 'anti-architectural' device due to its `high maintenance liabilities`. For example, refactoring code may make the unit tests non-functional, which requires rewriting them, which is time-consuming. Therefore, unit tests may not give a good return on investment.
